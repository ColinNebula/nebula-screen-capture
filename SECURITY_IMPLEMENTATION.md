# 🔒 Security Implementation Summary

## Overview
Nebula Screen Capture has been fortified with comprehensive security measures to protect against malware, manipulation, and various attack vectors both from GitHub and the internet.

## ✅ Security Layers Implemented

### 1. HTTP Security Headers (public/index.html)
```
✓ Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
✓ X-Frame-Options: DENY
✓ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
✓ X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
✓ Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
✓ Permissions-Policy (camera, microphone, etc.)
```

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization (src/utils/security.js)
```
✓ HTML sanitization (prevents XSS)
✓ URL validation (prevents malicious redirects)
✓ Email validation
✓ SQL injection detection
✓ Filename sanitization (prevents path traversal)
✓ File type validation
✓ File size validation
```

### 3. Authentication Security
```
✓ Password hashing (SHA-256)
✓ Password strength validation
✓ Rate limiting (5 attempts/5 minutes)
✓ Session timeout (1 hour)
✓ Secure token generation
✓ Hidden admin access (Alt + O)
```

### 4. Data Protection
```
✓ Local storage encryption
✓ Data integrity checksums
✓ HTTPS enforcement
✓ Secure data transmission
✓ No sensitive data in URLs
```

### 5. GitHub Repository Security
```
✓ .gitattributes (prevents binary manipulation)
✓ .gitignore (blocks sensitive files)
✓ Automated security scanning workflow
✓ Dependency review action
✓ CodeQL security analysis
✓ Secret scanning ready
```

### 6. Automated Security Checks (.github/workflows/security.yml)
```
✓ npm audit on every push
✓ Dependency vulnerability scanning
✓ Secret pattern detection
✓ eval() usage detection
✓ dangerouslySetInnerHTML detection
✓ CSP header verification
✓ Weekly scheduled security audits
✓ PR security comments
```

### 7. Runtime Security Monitoring (src/utils/securityIntegrity.js)
```
✓ CSP configuration check
✓ Security headers verification
✓ XSS protection testing
✓ HTTPS protocol enforcement
✓ Mixed content detection
✓ Frame ancestor protection
✓ LocalStorage security audit
✓ Cookie security checks
```

### 8. Application Security (src/App.js)
```
✓ Security event logging
✓ DevTools detection (production)
✓ Console disabling (production)
✓ Corrupted data handling
✓ Security initialization on startup
```

## 🛡️ Protection Against Specific Threats

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- ✅ CSP headers block inline scripts
- ✅ All user input sanitized
- ✅ HTML encoding for display
- ✅ URL validation
- ✅ Automatic XSS pattern detection

### Clickjacking
- ✅ X-Frame-Options: DENY
- ✅ CSP frame-ancestors: none
- ✅ Frame detection monitoring

### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- ✅ SameSite cookies
- ✅ form-action CSP directive
- ✅ base-uri restriction

### SQL Injection
- ✅ Input pattern detection
- ✅ Parameterized queries (future backend)
- ✅ Input sanitization

### Malware/Code Injection
- ✅ File type validation
- ✅ File extension blocking (.exe, .bat, .sh)
- ✅ Dangerous script detection
- ✅ Path traversal prevention

### Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement
- ✅ upgrade-insecure-requests CSP
- ✅ Strict-Transport-Security (recommended)

### Brute Force Attacks
- ✅ Rate limiting (login, API)
- ✅ Account lockout
- ✅ Security event logging

### Data Theft
- ✅ No data transmitted externally
- ✅ Local storage encryption
- ✅ Referrer policy protection
- ✅ Permissions policy restrictions

### Dependency Vulnerabilities
- ✅ npm audit before every build
- ✅ Automated vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Dependabot integration ready
- ✅ Lock file integrity

### GitHub Repository Manipulation
- ✅ Branch protection (recommended)
- ✅ Signed commits (recommended)
- ✅ Code review requirements (recommended)
- ✅ .gitattributes protection
- ✅ Secret scanning

## 🚀 Quick Start Security Setup

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and change:
REACT_APP_ADMIN_USERNAME=your-admin
REACT_APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123!@#
```

### 2. Run Security Audit
```bash
npm run security:check
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Security Features

```

## 🎯 Security Best Practices

### Development
```bash
# Before committing
npm audit
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Before deploying
npm run audit
npm run build
```

### Production
```bash
# Always use HTTPS
# Never commit .env files
